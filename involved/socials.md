Are you a UCL student or staff member who makes software for research?

Would you like to? Is writing code part of your scientific or scholarly life?

Please join us for the UCL Research Programming Technical Socials.

In these informal events, you can learn about useful tools and techniques which will help with your research
while meeting other students and staff who use computers for science.

These are held monthly, 16.30-18.00, with a format as follows:

* 1630-1710: Short talk on a tool, program, environment, language or technique of general interest to programming researchers.
* 1710-1800: Discussion of a matter of interest to programming researchers, inspired by the talk, over pizza and drinks.
* 1800:      Retire to an appropriate social venue.

Scheduled events:

* Wednesday 9 December 2015: Dr Dan Buchan, "Stop Writing So Much Code"
* [Register through Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/research-programming-technical-social-december-2015-tickets-19888564231)

> Computer Science and Software development are notoriously hard and complicated. Nevetheless programmers frequently prefer to implement their own solutions to problems rather that utilise the work of others. In this talk, I'll look at reasons for this behaviour, the pitfalls it can cause your projects and hopefully give you sufficient insight to avoid falling in to this trap yourself.
