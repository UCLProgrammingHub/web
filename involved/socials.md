Are you a UCL student or staff member who makes software for research?

Would you like to? Is writing code part of your scientific or scholarly life?

Please join us for the UCL Research Programming Technical Socials.

In these informal events, you can learn about useful tools and techniques which will help with your research
while meeting other students and staff who use computers for science.

These are held monthly, 16.30-18.00, with a format as follows:

* 1630-1710: Short talk on a tool, program, environment, language or technique of general interest to programming researchers.
* 1710-1800: Discussion of a matter of interest to programming researchers, inspired by the talk, over pizza and drinks.
* 1800:      Retire to an appropriate social venue.

Scheduled events:

* Wednesday 14 October 2015: Dr Ian Sillitoe, "Scalable Web Engineering at UCL"
* Tuesday 10 November 2015: Dr Marzia Rivi, "Parallel programming: a brief discussion"
* Wednesday 9 December 2015: Dr Dan Buchan, "Not Invented Here"
