Are you a UCL student or staff member who makes software for research?
Would you like to? Is writing code part of your scientific or scholarly life?
If so, please join us:

Instant Messaging Forum
-----------------------

We get together as a community in a [Slack](https://ucl-programming-hub.slack.com/) instant messaging channel on the web.
Please join us by signing up with an @ucl.ac.uk email address. You can also join our [mailing list](https://www.mailinglists.ucl.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/research-programming) for announcements.

Coffee Mornings
---------------

Another way to get involved is to turn up to our regular coffee mornings,
which take place every Wednesday at 10.15 in the [Housman Room](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/maps/housman-room).

Technical Socials
-----------------

In these informal events, you can learn about useful tools and techniques which will help with your research
while meeting other students and staff who use computers for science.

We're looking for volunteers to lead these events in 2016.
If you're interested please contact us through the [Slack](https://ucl-programming-hub.slack.com/)
forum.

These are held monthly, 16.30-18.00, with a format as follows:

* 1630-1710: Short talk on a tool, program, environment, language or technique of general interest to programming researchers.
* 1710-1800: Discussion of a matter of interest to programming researchers, inspired by the talk, over pizza and drinks.
* 1800:      Retire to an appropriate social venue.

Join our [mailing list](https://www.mailinglists.ucl.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/research-programming)
and/or the slack forum for announcements of these events.
