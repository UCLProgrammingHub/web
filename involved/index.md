We get together as a community in a [Slack](https://ucl-programming-hub.slack.com/) instant messaging channel on the web.
Please join us by signing up with an @ucl.ac.uk email address. You can also join our [mailing list](https://www.mailinglists.ucl.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/research-programming) for announcements.

Another way to get involved is to turn up to our regular coffee mornings, which take place every Wednesday at 10.15 in the [Housman Room](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/maps/housman-room).

In addition, we will be organising a series of events in UCL to bring the research programming community together: the Research Programming Technical [Socials](socials.html).
