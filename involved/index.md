Are you a UCL student or staff member who makes software for research?
Would you like to? Is writing code part of your scientific or scholarly life?
If so, please join us:

Instant Messaging Forum
-----------------------

We get together as a community in a [Slack](https://ucl-programming-hub.slack.com/) instant messaging channel on the web.
Please join us by signing up with an @ucl.ac.uk email address.
You can also join the RITS [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/bBs6ov) for announcements. 

Coffee Mornings
---------------

Another way to get involved is to turn up to our regular coffee mornings,
which take place every Wednesday at 10.15 in the [Housman Room](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/maps/housman-room).

Technical Socials
-----------------

In these informal events, you can learn about useful tools and techniques which will help with your research
while meeting other students and staff who use computers for science.

We're looking for volunteers to lead these events in 2016.
If you're interested please contact us through the [Slack](https://ucl-programming-hub.slack.com/)
forum.

These are held monthly, 17.00-18.30, with a format as follows:

* 1700-1740: Short talk on a tool, program, environment, language or technique of general interest to programming researchers.
* 1740-1830: Discussion of a matter of interest to programming researchers, inspired by the talk, over pizza and drinks.
* 1830:      Optionally retire to an appropriate social venue.

You can see the slides from past events on our [talks page](../presentations)

Upcoming events: (Preliminary titles TBC.)

* 11 February 2016: Jeremy Appleyard: ["Profiling GPU Applications."](https://ucltechsocialfeb16.eventbrite.co.uk)
* 14 March 2016: Raquel Alegre: ["Making sense of geospatial data with CartoDB maps."](https://ucltechsocialmar16.eventbrite.co.uk)
* 20th April 2016: Tom Doel and Mark White: ["Working with and anonymising sensitive data."](https://ucltechsocialapr16.eventbrite.co.uk)

We also plan to connect a number of special interest groups in UCL,
the first one of which is based on UCL's [NVidia GPU Research Center](gpu.html).
