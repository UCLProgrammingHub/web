UCL NVidia GPU Developers' Forum
==============================

UCL has been awarded [NVidia GPU Resesearch Center status](https://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/news/ucl-named-an-nvidia-gpu-research-centre/), and this is hosted through the UCL Research Programming Hub.

As part of this initiative, UCL RITS hosts a number of NVidia GPUs and other accelerators within the Legion cluster.
For more information about how to access these, see the notes on the
[Legion User Guide](https://wiki.rc.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/Legion_GPU_nodes) UCL researchers also have access to
the [Emerald](https://wiki.rc.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/Emerald) GPU cluster.

For advanced NVidia programming queries, UCL researchers enjoy, through this programme,
a designated NVIDIA technical liaison. Researchers should first, however, raise queries through the Research Programming Hub's
friendly [instant messaging channel](https://ucl-programming-hub.slack.com/), where questions may be answered by
research colleagues, or by members of the RITS support team.

Related Events
--------------

We will be hosting a number of events and training courses related to the GPU Research Center.

To celebrate this, and to further discuss how to advance UCL’s work in this area, please join us for a launch meeting between 18:00 and 20:00, on Wednesday 3rd Feb 2016, in Robert building room G.08, and the Engineering Front Building foyer.

Poster pods will be available for research groups to present their work using accelerators and GPUs; if you wish to display a poster, please send a copy by Friday 22nd January 2016 to James Hetherington (j.hetherington@ucl.ac.uk), the best poster will receive a small prize from NVIDIA. (Please print the poster yourself, or re-use a previous poster).
