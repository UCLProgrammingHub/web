UCL NVidia GPU Research Center
==============================

UCL has been awarded [NVidia GPU Resesearch Center status](https://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/news/ucl-named-an-nvidia-gpu-research-centre/), and this is hosted through the UCL Research Programming Hub.

As part of this initiative, UCL RITS hosts a number of NVidia GPUs and other accelerators within the Legion cluster.
For more information about how to access these, see the notes on the
[Legion User Guide](https://wiki.rc.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/Legion_GPU_nodes) UCL researchers also have access to
the [Emerald](https://wiki.rc.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/Emerald) GPU cluster.

For advanced NVidia programming queries, UCL researchers enjoy, through this programme,
a designated NVIDIA technical liaison.

Researchers should first, however, raise queries through the Research Programming Hub's
friendly [instant messaging channel](https://ucl-programming-hub.slack.com/), where questions may be answered by
research colleagues, or by members of the RITS support team.

Related Events
--------------

We will be hosting a number of events and training courses related to the GPU Research Center.

The first is a celebratory “Town Hall Meeting”, 1700-1900, on Friday 27th November,
in the Haldane Room and North Cloisters, UCL. Speakers will include Jack Watts of Nvidia, 
to introduce the GPU collaboration, and Daghan Cam, of UCL Barlett School of Architecture, 
to present some examples of UCL research in this space. Formal talks and discussion will conclude at 1800, 
to enable discussion and networking in the North Cloisters
over refreshments. Poster pods will be available for researcher groups to present their work using 
accelerators and GPUs; if you wish to display a poster, please send a copy to j.hetherington@ucl.ac.uk, 
the best poster will receive a small prize from Nvidia.
