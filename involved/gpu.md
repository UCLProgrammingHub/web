UCL NVidia GPU Developers' Forum
==============================

UCL has been awarded [NVidia GPU Research Center status](https://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/news/ucl-named-an-nvidia-gpu-research-centre/), and this is hosted through the UCL Research Programming Hub.

As part of this initiative, UCL RITS hosts a number of NVidia GPUs and other accelerators within the Legion cluster, including a Tesla K40c provided by NVidia through this initiative.
For more information about how to access these, see the notes on the
[Legion User Guide](https://wiki.rc.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/Legion_GPU_nodes). UCL researchers also have access to
the [Emerald](https://wiki.rc.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/Emerald) GPU cluster.

For advanced NVidia programming queries, UCL researchers enjoy, through this programme,
a designated NVIDIA technical liaison. Researchers should first, however, raise queries through the Research Programming Hub's
friendly [instant messaging channel](https://ucl-programming-hub.slack.com/), where questions may be answered by
research colleagues, or by members of the RITS support team. (See the `#Accelerators` channel in that forum.)
